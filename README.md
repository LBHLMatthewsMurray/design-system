# Home Office Digital Patterns

## What is this
A pattern library is a collection of digital design styles that have been created to solve user needs. 

These patterns complement the existing [GOV.UK design patterns](govuk-elements.herokuapp.com). This is a design pattern library for the Home Office Digital team created to share patterns that help designers and developers collaborate and develop reusable design patterns.
