# Icons content
The benefit of icons are to categorised as helping users navigate through the service. Controlers help users to sort, organise and adjust the information in the service â€“ this can be a filter, closing modals or revealing addition content. Quick reference is the most subjective area and is relevant to the users, frequency of interaction with the service and reason for needing a quick reference icon/image.

The risk with using icons for quick reference is that users won't read/understand what the link is. The options are all very similar and the users clicks the wrong one. The options are similar and therefore either the same icons are used (which slows down interactions and increases cognitive load), or additional icons are needed with only slight changes which are hard to differentiate and increase cognitive load and reduce comprehension.

Identifying whether your icons fit into one of these uses will help to answer whether it's appropriate to use it.

## Uses of icons
* navigation (through the service)
* controllers (sorting and filtering)
* quick reference (help identify options)
