# Modal content
Modals can be useful because they focus the user on completing a specific action, this is particularly beneficial on complicated interactions or when space is at a premium. They can be useful because, in a similar way to accordions, the interaction is conditional, the user has chosen to interact with the object. Modals or dialog boxes should be used very sparingly. They force the user away from the context of the page they are on and increase cognitive load. 

They should only occur if the user has actioned and the interaction (modal) should be clear that this is going to happen.

There should be clear and easy actions for the user to close the modal, including keyboard, tabbing and voice enabled. 

## Content patterns
* Content that opens the modal should explain to the user what will happen
* The content of the modal should be focused on the single task and continue from the link/page

## Interaction patterns
* The modal should focus on a single task
* Consider an alternative approach to modals on mobile

## Inclusive patterns
* Include `ARIA` tags
* Include labels and tags 

## User research
* Encourages focus
* Complicated interactions within the modal dissorientate
* Multiple modals create confusion
* Test this version (CSS only) with form content

## Services using this pattern
* Application platform

## Things to do
* JS for keydown
