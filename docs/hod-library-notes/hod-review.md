Review process for including design patterns in the library

1. Has the design solved the problem?
2. Is there more than one example of a problem being solved?
3. Has it been simplified down?
4. Does it exist in the library (or is there something which solves the user need already)?
5. Is it appropriate?
6. Has the pattern been researched and tested?
7. Has the pattern been reviewed from an access needs perspective?
